# I Love ES6

Short ES6 codes

This is my way to practice the syntax and operation of the ES2015 / ES6 new features for JavaScript. The codes are simple and repetitive to build muscle memory for coding.

I used feature list from
* https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
